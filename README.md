#Simple Nest JS Api

This repo is created only for complete test assessment

To launch project:

For docker users: ```docker-compose run yarn && docker-compose up```

For native users: ```yarn && yarn start```

###TODOs
1. Use Observables
2. Add more tests (coverage should be > 60)
3. Validate config (Joi can be used)
4. Use typeorm-seeding with faker rather than module providers
